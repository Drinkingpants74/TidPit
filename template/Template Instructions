# Naming:
    Folder - All Lowercase, No Spaces
    Files - Module Name Is Lowercase, with a CamelCase Imports/Class/Add

# Imports:
    The Import Lines Needed For Your Module
    DO NOT DUPLICATE IMPORTS FROM OTHER MODULES

# Class:
    Add The TK Widgets You Wish under the __init__ function, and attach them
    to the "self" Frame.

    Any Functions You Need (API Calls, Text Setters, etc.), are defined inside
    the class as well.

    The Class acts as a Zip for your module, so keep everything you need inside that Zip.
