This file will explain all the rules and guidelines for creating a new Module for TidPit.
These rules exist to ensure compatibility with the Main Script and the Setup Script.
Custom Modules MUST follow the rules listed below:

# Naming:
    File - Lowercase
    Class - Capitalized File Name

    EX: clock.py -> Clock

# Imports:
    The only provided import is the TKInter modules, renamed to "tk".
    Any other imports you need may be added.

# Code Editing:
    You CANNOT modify the existing code.
    What has been given is the bare minimum required to work,
    and ensures compatibility with the Main Script.

    When Adding TKInter Widgets, attach them to "self", as the
    Class Object is a Frame Object.

# Persistent Variable:
    Variables SHOULD persist across display changes, but to
    ensure that is the case, I recommend using Global variables
    for anything you NEED to ensure persists, and Class Global
    variables for anything that you are okay with losing.

# Main Script Compatibility:
    The ONLY FUNCTIONS the main script will run are the init function, and restart.
    If you have functions that need to be run, call them from the inside either function.

    I recommend creating a Domino style of function execution.
    What this means is when One function is called, the rest
    are run sequentially after.

    EX: init() -> func1() -> func2() -> etc.

# Setup Script Compatibility:
    The Setup Script has a button titled "Extras" which is designed
    for Adding Custom Modules. Simply type in the File Name of your
    Module without the ".py" ending.

    EX: clock.py -> clock

    As a Custom Module, you will not be able to offer Customization
    options through the Setup Script. There are other ways though:

    * Create a separate Python file with the Settings you need inside
        Then have users Edit that file

    * Create your own Setup Script that handles ONLY your file.

    * Create an Unofficial Fork of this project and add your
        Customization Page as a Class inside setupClasses.py
