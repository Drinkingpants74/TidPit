## Can I Create My Own Module?
Yep. The best part about TidPit is that it's scalable. To create a new module, follow the Instructions
inside the "Template Instructions" file in the "template" foldder.

If you do make a new Module, share it with the class! I'd love to see what you can make, and if it's stable enough,
(and with permission), I'll add it as an official option.
